# Reelo-Question-Paper-Generator

#### The Reelo Question Paper Generator is a Django-based application designed to simplify the process of generating customized question papers. This application empowers users, allowing them to specify the distribution of questions based on different difficulty levels and the total number of questions required.

## Description

#####  The key functionality of this application lies in its ability to dynamically generate question papers by taking user-defined parameters into account. Users have the flexibility to specify the following:

##### Difficulty Levels: Users can set the percentages of questions for different difficulty levels (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard). For instance, a user might define 30% Easy, 40% Medium, and 30% Hard questions.

##### Total Number of Questions: Users can specify the total number of questions needed in the question paper.

##### Based on the provided percentages for difficulty levels and the total number of questions, the application intelligently creates question papers that adhere to these specifications. It ensures that the distribution of questions aligns with the user-defined percentages across different difficulty levels.
